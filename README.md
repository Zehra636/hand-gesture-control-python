# Hand Gesture Control System (Python & OpenCV)

## Overview
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python and OpenCV.  
The system captures live video from a webcam and processes frames to detect hand movements and gestures.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Features
- Real-time webcam capture
- Hand detection and tracking
- Distance-based gesture recognition
- Interactive control logic

## How It Works
1. Captures video stream from webcam.
2. Processes each frame using computer vision techniques.
3. Detects hand landmarks.
4. Calculates distance between fingers.
5. Triggers actions based on gesture patterns.

## Purpose
This project was developed to explore:
- Computer vision fundamentals
- Real-time image processing
- Human-computer interaction concepts
